We need SSH Services in order to establish a connection to localhost port 22.
Use the following commands to install SSH:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh
$ sudo systemctl start ssh
Use the following command to check the status of SSH:
$ sudo systemctl status ssh

After adding the user accounts using the "createaccounts.sh", ensure that we are able to establish a connection/login as the users using the following command:
$ ssh user01@localhost

This is to verify that our dormant account management tool is able to detect the users last logins.
