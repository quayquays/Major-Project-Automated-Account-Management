## Usage Steps

### 1. Create a directory, name it whatever you want. Just make sure it's in root. [ e.g /dormant , /Dormant etc..]. Make sure you put the following files in that directory. [âœ¨]

- dormant2.0.sh
- dormantui.sh
- server.py
- setup.sh

### 2. Run setup.sh

When running the file, you might face some errors while installing the dependencies. Which is normal, so do not fret ðŸ’–. 
Usually, from the output you can see on how to fix those issues.
After fixing it, run the setup.sh again and make sure everything is installed.


### 3. Check if everything is installed properly.

- Check if server.py runs in the background
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart serverpy.service
sudo systemctl status serverpy.service

If it gives errors try to kill the proccess:

sudo lsof -i :8080

sudo kill -9 <id>


 - Check for the log files
 cat /var/log/dormant.log
 cat /var/log/server.log

  - Check if dormant.sh is automatically installed in the cronjob.

    crontab -l
